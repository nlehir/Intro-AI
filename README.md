# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains slides and exercices for 5th year students at epitech for the course
"Introduction to AI".

Scripts contains errors on the default "exercise" branch. These exercises are
material for students to work locally after cloning the repository.

The branch "master" contains corrected scripts. Students are encouraged to
work rather with the "exercise" branch during the module, in order to have the
time to look for the solutions, that are discussed during the course.

## Jupyter notebooks
We can use the convenient jupyter notebooks during the course. 
This will allow us to run scripts in the browser.

### Installation
You need to have docker installed.
To install docker, please follow the instructions here:
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
The dockerfile sets the installation up.

### Build and launch by scripts
-   To build: ```./buildJupyterImage.sh```
-   To launch: ```./launchNotebookServer.sh```

### Open notebooks
Jupyter is a web app, to open your notebooks, open in your browser the following url:
